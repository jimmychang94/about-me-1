  <h1>My About Me Project</h1>

    <p>As a developer, I would like to be able to write clear, DRY code and know why     I am writing it so that I will have a strong foundation for learning in the       future.</p>
    <p>I am coding this project with three paragraphs to add content to the page.  I     hope to add a background color and text color.</p>
    <p>I hope to be able to add more to the page using CSS tomorrow and I'm looking      forward to it.</p>
